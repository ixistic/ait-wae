    <h3>What We Did</h3>
    <p>
      Before setting up the production server, we set up a testing production server on each of our local
      machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, we set up Apache 2 on the local machines. Using (1) and (6), we managed to get several virtual
      hosts with several server names, e.g., app1.prod, app2.dev, to show up on the localhost.
      Then we went on to install Ruby, Rails, and PostGreSql by using (1), (2), and (3). At first, the
      rails spat out this error message "Incomplete response received from application" on the browser.
      We managed to solve the error using (4). Afterward, we tried out scraping the top ten trending videos
      on YouTube, using (8), (9), and (10).
    </p>
    <p>
      Second, we set up the production server. To do that, we configured the proxy and SSH to get a server
      access through the CSIM's firewall. In addition to (1) and (5), we also used (7) to pass through the
      firewall and to change the connection port
      from 22 to 443 so that we could get a server access from outside the campus.
      After that, we set up the production server
      similar to the one we set up on the local machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we were working on the production server, we also documented the processes we went through and the
      sources we had used. When we managed to duplicate the testing server on the production server, we went
      on to complete the tasks as mentioned in the assignment 1.
